# Notes Wala Chad 

## How this works
**NotesChad is a platform to share and contribute your notes to the community. The project is open-source and you can see the source code at [Github](https://github.com/mairishavhoon/noteschad). The system is pretty simple. We just take handwritten notes, convert it into PDF and embed the download links. There are exceptions where we just share the source PDF and not handwritten stuff.**

## Design

The design of the website is fairly simple. The site uses **grids** to display various options. The design is **responsive** and works and looks good on almost every device. The Site's primary **colours are black and red**. The site uses many effects too. The sites's primary **font is Gotham** (Spotify uses this shit).

## Code

The code is very simple. The site only uses **HTML and CSS and no JavaScript**. That means this is hella **secure**. The site is **fast** as the images used are smol and the code uses on HTML and CSS. The entire code only uses a **single [CSS File](https://noteschad.netlify.app/style.css)**. All code is arranged pretty much systematically UwU.


## Development

Made this site in roughly **two days** in about 10 hours, thenks to VSCode and StackOverflow. Intially started with around 350 lines of code UwU. Site is **hosted on Netlify** (it's free). We **don't have a domain name** as we don't have any funds. Consider Donating (i know you won't).

## How to use?

Just open the site choose the site select the subject of which you want the notes. We don't have support for certain subjects for obvious reasons. Click on that stuff you will see similar menu with images of teacher's initals and click on that and there you have it.

## Contribute

We don't have a system to contribute through the site but we will add it soon. You can help NotesChad financially by donating. However if you still down bad to contribute mail to **rishav11227@gmail.com**.

## Future

We aim to launch an Android App soon and the functionality to contribute directly through the site.
